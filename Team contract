## Team expectations
- Generally, it‚Äôs not expected to work nights & weekends. However, if you want to and/or feel motivated to do so, make sure everyone knows what to-do item you are tackling (to avoid double work). 
- We will discuss weekend work later in the week, depending on our progress.
- If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another‚Äôs train of coding-thought
- Pairs will tackle all the front & backend parts of their to-do items.
- Message the group when you change what you are working on/give progress

## Issues
- Step 1) work within our pair to figure out a solution. If both are stumped...
- Step 2) slack the group slack with the issue and we can hop into each others breakout rooms on zoom to try to solve the issue together
- Step 3) Escalate to fellow if none of us can answer & we have decided (even after taking a break) that we‚Äôre still in need of help
- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps: Take 10-15 minute break, List out the pros / cons, Vote on it. If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
- If you are frustrated: Take a walk or get some water, Talk constructively about actionable items, use each other to Rubber Duck debug üê§, Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
